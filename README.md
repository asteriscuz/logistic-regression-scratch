Logistic Regression from Scratch (NumPy)

This project implements Logistic Regression from scratch using only NumPy. The model is trained and tested on the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn and compared against scikit-learn’s built-in implementation.

Features: 
- Sigmoid function with numerical stability (np.clip)
- Gradient descent optimization
- Methods for training (fit), prediction (predict), and evaluation (score)
- Benchmark against scikit-learn’s LogisticRegression
